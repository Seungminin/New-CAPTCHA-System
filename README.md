# New-CAPTCHA-System

## üîç Background

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) systems have long been used as a defense mechanism against automated bots. However, recent advancements in machine learning have made it increasingly easier for AI-powered programs to bypass conventional CAPTCHA mechanisms, including both text-based and image-based CAPTCHAs.

![Previous CAPTCHA Research and Defeat Methods](./assets/captcha_background.png)

As shown in the image above:
- Traditional CAPTCHA systems such as reCAPTCHA v2 and FunCaptcha have been successfully solved using deep learning techniques.
- For example, character-based CAPTCHA has been defeated via segmentation and denoising pipelines, and even reCAPTCHA v2 image challenges can be broken using object detection models like YOLOv8.
- These breakthroughs enable bots to solve CAPTCHA in under 10 seconds at very low costs, posing a significant security threat.

With the increasing sophistication of these automated solvers, a new form of CAPTCHA is required ‚Äî one that better exploits the **cognitive gap between humans and machines**.

## üß† Our Approach

To address this issue, we propose a **Multi-Modal CAPTCHA system** that leverages:
- Visual reasoning
- Human intuition
- Real-time interaction

Instead of asking users to simply click or type, our system requires users to **draw** or **highlight** semantic regions (e.g., cloud shapes, dangerous objects), which introduces complexity that is **trivial for humans but difficult for machines**.

Our goal is to develop a CAPTCHA system that:
- Adapts to various visual prompts
- Is resistant to automation attacks
- Maintains usability and accessibility for real users
  
## üß† Deep Learning Approach

To develop a CAPTCHA system that cannot be easily defeated by automated bots, we designed a novel pipeline involving generative and discriminative deep learning models.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Generation with DCGAN

We employed a **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)** architecture to generate realistic but ambiguous images. These images are:
- Visually confirmable by humans.
- Diverse in representation (no mode collapse).
- Difficult for machines to categorize with high certainty.

![Generated Samples from DCGAN](./assets/dcgan_samples.png)

> ‚úÖ The goal: Humans can intuitively classify these images, but machines cannot reliably sort or label them.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation using ResNet18 Classifier

To validate the effectiveness of our generated CAPTCHA images, we conducted an evaluation using **ResNet18**, a well-known image classification model.

- The ResNet18 model was fine-tuned on the original dataset with high accuracy (~47% F1-score).
- When tested on a **grid of GAN-generated samples**, the model‚Äôs F1-score **dropped significantly to 12%**, indicating that:
  - The generated samples do not align well with known class distributions.
  - Machines struggle to infer semantic meaning from our synthesized data.

![Evaluation Drop Using ResNet18](./assets/resnet18_accuracy_drop.png)

This demonstrates that our CAPTCHA system leverages the **cognitive gap between human and machine perception**, successfully degrading model confidence while maintaining human interpretability.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cognitive Illusion-Based CAPTCHA with Diffusion Models

In addition to GAN-generated visuals, we developed an advanced CAPTCHA mechanism based on **Illusion Diffusion**, a recent variant of Stable Diffusion that leverages perceptual ambiguity to confuse automated recognition systems.

![Illusion Diffusion Example](./assets/illusion_diffusion.png)

We intentionally generated images that exhibit **mirrored or illusory structures**, which are easily distinguishable by humans but introduce significant confusion to machine vision models.

---

### üîç Benchmarking Against SAM and YOLOv11

To evaluate the difficulty of our CAPTCHA images from a machine learning standpoint, we tested them against:
- **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** for object-level segmentation.
- **YOLOv11** for object classification and detection.

![SAM and YOLOv11 Results](./assets/sam_yolo_results.png)

While SAM was able to segment the object contours, and YOLOv11 attempted classification, the models:
- **Failed to correctly classify target objects like "giraffe" or "penguin"** in many scenarios.
- Showed **confused logits across unrelated classes** such as "cat", "potted plant", or "scissors".
- Generated bounding boxes that often missed key regions.

This reinforces our hypothesis that **humans can still intuitively identify the right patterns**, while **machines lack the semantic context to succeed**.

### üß™ Human-in-the-Loop CAPTCHA Example

Below is an example from our system where users are asked to **select all images containing erasers**, while the reference image above is based on Illusion Diffusion outputs.

![User CAPTCHA Challenge](./assets/human_challenge_example.png)

This interactive format ensures:
- High accuracy from genuine human users.
- Low success rates for automated bots and model-based solvers.
## üé® Multi-Dimensional CAPTCHA: Drawing-Based Interaction

As our third method, we propose a **Multi-Dimensional CAPTCHA** system that challenges users to interact with AI-generated images in a more semantically demanding way ‚Äî by drawing or highlighting specific objects within the image.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Image Generation via Stable Diffusion

We utilize **Stable Diffusion** with carefully designed prompts to synthesize high-quality images featuring specific semantic elements such as:
- Fluffy clouds
- Cotton candy
- Chimney smoke

![Stable Diffusion Prompts and Results](./assets/stable_diffusion_prompt_results.png)

These prompts allow for the creation of scenes that are rich in content but visually similar across object types ‚Äî increasing difficulty for automated solvers while maintaining intuitive understanding for humans.

---

### üß† The Multi-Modal Challenge

Users are prompted with tasks like:

> "Please highlight the clouds in the image below."

Then, using a mouse or touch interface, users **draw directly on the image** to identify the target region.

On the backend:
- We employ a **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** to interpret the prompt.
- A model like **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** generates segmentation masks of the image.
- However, selecting the correct mask for the queried class (e.g., ‚Äúcloud‚Äù) requires resolving **vision-language alignment**, which is still a challenge for machines.

### ‚úÖ Security & Effectiveness

This system is effective because:

- üîí **Hard for Bots**: It‚Äôs difficult for an automated system to draw the correct region without understanding the prompt and visual content together.
- üë§ **Easy for Humans**: Humans naturally perceive visual objects and semantic meaning, allowing them to perform the task with ease.
- üß™ **Robust Evaluation**: We compare the user-drawn mask with the ground truth mask and compute IoU (Intersection over Union) to determine success.

![Final CAPTCHA UI Example](./assets/multidimension_captcha_ui.png)

This **multi-dimensional approach** highlights the cognitive advantage humans have over machines, making our CAPTCHA system not only secure, but also adaptable to real-world semantic reasoning.
